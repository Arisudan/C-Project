using namespace std;

int main() {
  // Create a deque called cars that will store strings
  deque<string> cars = {"Volvo", "BMW", "Ford", "Mazda"};

  // Try to access an element that does not exist (will throw an exception)
  cout << cars.at(9);

}

OUTPUT:
terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::out_of_range'
  what():  deque::_M_range_check: __n (which is 9)>= this->size() (which is 4)
