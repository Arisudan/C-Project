# Stack:
A stack stores multiple elements in a specific order, called **LIFO**.

LIFO stands for **Last in, First Out**. 
1) To vizualise LIFO, think of a pile of pancakes, where pancakes are both added and removed from the top. So when removing a pancake, it will always be the last one you added. 
2) This way of organizing elements is called LIFO in computer science and programming.

Unlike vectors, **elements in the stack are not accessed by index numbers**. Since elements are added and removed from the top, you can **only access the element at the top of the stack**.

# To use a stack, you have to include the <stack> header file:
                #include <stack>
